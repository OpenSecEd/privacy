In this session we look at differential privacy~\cite{DifferentialPrivacy}.
We review the definitions of what it is and look at a variety of uses.

The literature we rely on consists of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \citetitle{DifferentialPrivacy}~\cite{DifferentialPrivacy}
\item \citetitle{DiffPrivSurvey}~\cite{DiffPrivSurvey}
\end{itemize}
The above cover the basic theory of differential privacy.
We will furthermore look at an interesting application of differential privacy 
in:
\begin{itemize}
\item \citetitle{ChallengingDiffPriv}~\cite{ChallengingDiffPriv}
\item \citetitle{BLIP-1}~\cite{BLIP-1}
\item \citetitle{BLIP-2}~\cite{BLIP-2}
\end{itemize}
